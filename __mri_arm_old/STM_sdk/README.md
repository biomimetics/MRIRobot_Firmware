# STM_sdk
These files were generated with STM32CubeMX using the settings defined in the project file stm32cubemx/sdk_gen_proj.ioc.

To replace these files, update the sd_gen_proj.ioc project and regenerate the code into stm32cubemx or another folder. Then, replace all files in Core and Drivers *except* main.c and main.h as those contain some definitions used in the Main.lf and other .lf dependent files.
