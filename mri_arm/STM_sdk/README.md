# STM_sdk
These files were generated with the STM32CubeMX software using the settings defined in the project file stm32cubemx/sdk_gen_proj.ioc.

To replace these files, load sdk_gen_proj.ioc in either STM32CubeMX or STM32CubeIDE and update the sdk_gen_proj.ioc project and regenerate the code into stm32cubemx or another folder. Then, replace all files in Core and Drivers *except* main.c and main.h as those contain some definitions used in the Main.lf and other .lf dependent files.
